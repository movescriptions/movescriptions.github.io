Movescriptions is a Semi-Fungible Assets protocol based on the Move language. It's a public good, developed openly by the [MoveFunsDAO](https://github.com/movefuns/) community, dedicated to building for the public.

## Motivation

Inspired by the [Ordinals Inscription protocol](https://docs.ordinals.com/) on Bitcoin and its derivative protocol [BRC20](https://layer1.gitbook.io/layer1-foundation/protocols/brc-20/documentation), the Movescriptions protocol aims to enhance and expand the capabilities of Inscriptions using the Move smart contract language. Our goal is to fully leverage Move's resource expression capabilities to enhance and extend the functionality of the Inscription protocol, we can call it **Smart Inscription**.

## Key insights from Inscription

The Inscription protocol provides two key insights that guide our direction for innovation:

1. Technical Perspective: Inscription, combined with BRC20, offers a semi-fungible asset representation based on data structure patterns, differing from the interface-based asset representation in Solidity.
2. Ecological Perspective: The key is providing a fair launch mechanism that allows user participation and benefit.

## Overview of the Solution

The core of the Movescriptions protocol includes:

1. Expressing semi-fungible assets through the Move language.
2. Implementing multi fair distribution mechanisms.
